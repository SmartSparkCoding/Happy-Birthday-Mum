    <p>Dear Mummy,</p>

    <p>You do everything for me, and I am really am grateful for everything you do for not only me, but Dad, Ollie, Grannie, Grandad, and even Ebony, Bear and Blackjack!</p>
    <p>So please, take this day off, as you really deserve it.</p>
    <p>But before we do that...</p>

    </div>

    <div id="memories">
        <p>Do you remember all the things we did together? Well I can't and I will tell you why!</p>
        <p>Because there are so many things we have done together, that I can't remember them all! But I will try to remember some of them...</p>
        <p>We have been to the beach, we have been to the park, we have been to the zoo, we have been to the cinema, we have been to the shops, we have been to the library, we have been to the museum, we have been to the aquarium, we have been to the farm, and we have been EVERYWHERE!</p>
